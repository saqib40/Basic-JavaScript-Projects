        But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncingpleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a completeaccount of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the greatexplorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No onerejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationallyencounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is thereanyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, becauseit is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toiland pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example,which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except toobtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault witha man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences,or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

        On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislikemen who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of themoment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain andtrouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those whofail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as sayingthrough shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simpleand easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice isuntrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we likebest, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But incertain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligationsof business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to berepudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holdsin these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures tosecure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worsepains.
